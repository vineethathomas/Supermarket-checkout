# supermarket checkout application

Coding Challenge

# Development Approach

- Used Apache Maven as build tool

- Used TDD with Mockito and Junit for testing

- Done one scenario of integration testing (Used instance provided in the question)

# Design Principles

- Used Abstract class and implementation classes for creating rules.

- Used Enum to define current list of items so that it can be reused for future development.

- Currency configured

# Improvements (Not done)

- Discount rules could have been optimised with an xml or so to avoid code dependency.

- Could have added more integration scenarios.
